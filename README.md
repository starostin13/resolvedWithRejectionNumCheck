# resolvedWithRejectionNumCheck
1. Using JS or TS implement resolvedWithRejectionNumCheck(promisesToHandle: Promise[], maxRejectedNum: number) method which returns a promise that: - resolves if amount of rejected promises from promisesToHandle is not greater than the maxRejectedNum value - rejects otherwise
2. Create a few autotests for this method using any testing framework.
